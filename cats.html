    <h1>FASCINATING FACTS ABOUT CATS.</h1>
    <p><img class="contimg" src="images/abtcats.jpg" alt="a picture of a cat"></p>
    <p>From the time you wake up with a fluffy pile purring on your face to the time you go to bed with that fluffy pile
        purring on your face again, there are a lot of reasons to love our cats. </p>
    <ol>
        <li>CATS SPEND BETWEEN 30 TO 50 PERCENT OF THEIR DAY GROOMING THEMSELVES.
            <p><img class="contimg" src="images/abtcats1.jpg" alt="a picture of a cat"></p>
            <p>Are you that clean? This behavior serves several purposes: It helps cats tone down their scent so they
                can avoid predators, it cools them down, it promotes blood flow, and it distributes natural oils evenly
                around their coat, allowing them to stay warm and dry. Grooming also serves as a sign of affection
                between two cats, and it’s thought that saliva contains enzymes that serve as a natural antibiotic for
                wounds.</p>
        </li>
        <li>PURRING DOESN'T ALWAYS MEAN A CAT IS HAPPY.
            <p>Cats often make the sound when they’re content, but they also purr when they’re sick, stressed, hurt, or
                giving birth.</p>
        </li>
        <li>IT'S POSSIBLE THAT PURRING HELPS BONE DENSITY.
            <p>Scientists don’t quite know why cats purr, but one hypothesis is that the sound frequency of
                purring—between 25 and 150 Hertz—"can improve bone density and promote healing," theorizes Leslie A.
                Lyons, an assistant professor at the School of Veterinary Medicine at the University of California,
                Davis, in an article for Scientific American. "Because cats have adapted to conserve energy via long
                periods of rest and sleep, it is possible that purring is a low energy mechanism that stimulates muscles
                and bones without a lot of energy."</p>
        </li>
        <li>A CAT'S NOSE HAS CATNIP RECEPTORS.
            <p><img class="contimg" src="images/abtcats2.jpg" alt="a picture of a cat"></p>
            <p>Ever wonder why catnip lulls felines into a trance? The herb contains several chemical compounds,
                including one called nepetalactone, which a cat detects with receptors in its nose and mouth. The
                compounds trigger the typical odd behaviors you associate with the wacky kitty weed, including sniffing,
                head shaking, head rubbing, and rolling around on the ground.</p>
        </li>
        <li> BUT MOST CATS DON'T RESPOND TO CATNIP.
            <p>More than half of the world’s felines don’t respond to catnip. Scientists still don’t know quite why some
                kitties go crazy for the aromatic herb and others don’t, but they have figured out that catnip
                sensitivity is hereditary. If a kitten has one catnip-sensitive parent, there’s a one-in-two chance that
                it will also grow up to crave the plant. And if both parents react to 'nip, the odds increase to at
                least three in four.</p>
        </li>
        <li>CATS MAKE GREAT PRIVATE DETECTIVES.
            <p>Can’t afford a private eye? A feline might be able do the job for free. In the 1960s, ambassador Henry
                Helb—who then lived in the Dutch Embassy in Moscow—noticed that his two Siamese kitties were arching
                their backs and clawing at one of the walls. Helb had a hunch that the cats heard something he couldn’t,
                and sure enough, he found 30 tiny microphones hidden behind the boards. Instead of busting the spies,
                Helb and his staff took advantage of the surveillance and griped about household repairs or packages
                stuck in customs while standing in front of the mics. The eavesdroppers took care of their
                complaints—and apart from Helb and his companions, no one was the wiser.</p>
        </li>
        <li> THE WEALTHIEST CAT IS NAMED BLACKIE.
            <p>A rich British antique dealer named Ben Rea loved his cat Blackie so much that when he died in 1988, he
                left most of his estate—totaling nearly $13 million—to the lucky (albeit likely indifferent) feline. The
                money was split among three cat charities, which had been instructed to keep an eye on Rea’s beloved
                companion. To this day, Blackie holds the Guinness World Record for Wealthiest Cat.</p>
        </li>
        <li> YOUR CAT PROBABLY HATES MUSIC.
            <p><img class="contimg" src="images/abtcats3.jpg" alt="a picture of a cat"></p>
            <p>But they might like tunes written by composer David Teie, who partnered with animal scientists to make an
                album called Music for Cats. Released in 2015, the songs are “based on feline vocal communication and
                environmental sounds that pique the interest of cats,” Teie’s website states.</p>
        </li>
        <li>A GROUP OF KITTENS IS A KINDLE.</li>
        <p>A kindle isn’t just an e-reader—it’s also a word that’s used to describe a group of kittens born to one mama
            cat. Meanwhile, a group of full-grown cats is called a clowder.</p>
        <li>MANY HISTORICAL FIGURES LOVED CATS.
            <p>If you adore felines, you’re in good company: Many of history’s most famous figures—including Florence
                Nightingale, Pope Paul II, Mark Twain, and the Brontë sisters—all owned, and loved, cats.</p>
        </li>
        <li>ABRAHAM LINCOLN WAS A HUGE FAN OF CATS.
            <p><img class="contimg" src="images/ablincoln.jpg" alt="a picture of abraham lincoln"></p>
            <p>Still, the title of history’s craziest cat man might go to Abraham Lincoln. Mary Todd Lincoln was once
                asked if her husband had any hobbies. Her response? “Cats!” (He also liked dogs.)</p>
        </li>
        <li>IF YOU LOVE CATS, YOU'RE AN AILUROPHILE.
            <p>Looking to elevate your vocabulary? Try using the word ailurophile in a casual conversation. It’s a fancy
                word for "cat lover," and it’s derived from the Greek word for cat, ailouros, and the suffix -phile,
                meaning "lover." Conversely, the word ailurophobe—a combination of ailouros plus phobe—describes someone
                who hates cats.</p>
        </li>
        <li>CATS FIRST WENT TO SPACE IN 1963.
            <p>On October 18, 1963, French scientists used a rocket to launch the first cat into space. The feline’s
                name was Félicette, and she made it safely to the ground following a parachute descent. Almost
                definitely landing on her feet.</p>
        </li>
        <li>THE WORLD'S OLDEST LIVING CAT IS 31 YEARS OLD.
            <p>As for the world’s oldest living cat, the title belongs to a sometimes-cranky white-and-orange kitty
                named Rubble, who celebrated his 31st birthday in June. The average lifespan is 12-18 years.</p>
        </li>
        <li>CATS MIGHT BE MARKING YOU AS TERRITORY WHEN THEY MASSAGE YOU.
            <p>Sounds right. Experts haven’t figured out why cats like to knead, but they’ve come up with several
                possible explanations, one being that your kitty is trying to mark their "territory" (that’s you!) with
                the scent glands in their paws. And since kittens knead their mama’s belly to stimulate milk production,
                there’s also a chance that they carry this behavior into adulthood—a phenomenon known as a "neotenic
                behavior."</p>
        </li>
        <li>THERE'S A CAT PAINTING WORTH CLOSE TO $1 MILLION.
            <p>In 2015, a 6-by-8.5-foot oil painting billed as the "world’s largest cat painting" sold at auction for
                more than $820,000. It’s called My Wife's Lovers, and it once belonged to a wealthy philanthropist named
                Kate Birdsall Johnson. She loved felines so much that she owned dozens (some even say hundreds) of
                kitties, and commissioned a painter to capture her Turkish Angoras and Persians in their natural
                element. Since Johnson’s husband called the clowder "my wife’s lovers," the nickname was selected as the
                artwork’s title.</p>
        </li>
        <li> T.S. ELIOT THOUGHT CATS WERE MORE POETIC THAN DOGS.
            <p>The musical Cats is based on a collection of T.S. Eliot poems called Old Possum’s Book of Practical Cats.
                Published in 1939, it follows the whimsical antics of a group of felines—but the manuscript was
                originally intended to feature dogs, too. In the end, though, Eliot determined that "dogs don’t seem to
                lend themselves to verse quite so well, collectively, as cats."</p>
        </li>
        <li>YOUR CAT MIGHT BE ALLERGIC TO YOU.
            <p><img class="contimg" src="images/abtcats4.jpg" alt="a picture of a cat"></p>
            <p>Usually we think it's the other way around, but even if you’re not allergic to cats, your cat might be
                allergic to you. One in 200 cats are believed to have asthma—and this number continues to rise among
                indoor kitties as they're more frequently exposed to cigarette smoke, dust, human dandruff, and pollen.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li> THERE ARE MORE PET CATS IN THE U.S. THAN PET DOGS.
            <p>There are an estimated 85.8 million pet cats in the U.S. In contrast, there are only an estimated 78
                million dogs.</p>
        </li>
        <li>NOT ALL HISTORICAL FIGURES LOVED CATS.
            <p><img class="contimg" src="images/abtcats5.jpg" alt="a picture of a cat"></p>
            <p>Napoleon, Caesar, Genghis Khan, and Hitler are all said to have hated cats</p>
        </li>
        <li>CATS CAN JUMP UP TO FIVE TIMES THEIR OWN HEIGHT.
            <p>Or six times its length—and make the entire thing look easy.</p>
        </li>
