        <li>Dogs noses are wet to help absorb scent chemicals
            <p>This amazing dog fact might answer a long-standing question that dog owners have. Why are dogs noses wet?
                Vetstreet says that the answer is that dog’s noses are wet to help them absorb scent chemicals! Their
                nose secretes a special mucus that helps to absorb these chemicals, and then they lick their noses to
                sample them, helping them understand what the smell is.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Newfoundlands are amazing lifeguards
            <p>Newfoundland dogs are the ultimate doggy lifeguards, because they have water resistant coats and webbed
                feet. They were originally bred as fisherman’s helpers and to rescue people from drowning.</p>

            <p>Some owners have even reported that their Newfoundland tries to “rescue” them when they’re swimming!</p>

                Greyhounds are excellent long distance runners and can keep a speed of 35mph for up to 7 miles.</p>

            <p>Where the Cheetah is incredibly fast it can only keep its speed for around 200 -300 yards, so they may
