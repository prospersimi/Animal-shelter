    <h2>THE AMERICAN BULL DOG.</h2>
    <img src="images/american-bulldog.jpg"alt="an american bulldog">
    <p>The American Bulldog is stocky and muscular, but also agile and built for chasing down stray cattle and helping with farm work. In fact, some are known to jump six feet or more into the air.</p>
    <p>American Bulldogs are intelligent and affectionate, which makes them great, protective family dogs; although, they have high exercise needs and require an experienced, active pet parent. They can vary in appearance, as there are multiple types, including the Bully or Classic type, also known as the Johnson type, the Standard or Performance type, also called the Scott type, and hybrids of the two.</p>
    <p>With patient training and care, American Bulldogs can make loving family companions. If youâ€™re looking for a loving, energetic best buddy, then this may be the dog for you!</p>
    <h3>Personality</h3>
    <p>American Bulldogs are friendly, intelligent, and affectionate, though that affectionate nature often leads them to be territorial and overly suspicious of strangers. This makes them lovely family dogs and watchdogs, even for families with children, but they will need socialization training, especially as puppies to get along with unfamiliar humans or other dogs that stop by for a visit. Luckily, their intelligence makes them highly adaptable and trainable.</p>
    <h3>Health</h3>
    <p>The American Bulldog is generally a healthy breed with a life expectancy of 10 to 16 years. Some are predisposed to certain medical conditions such as cataracts, mange, or hypothyroidism. If they suffer from obesity early in life, they may develop hip or elbow dysplasia.</p>

    <p>The breed is somewhat brachycephalic, meaning they have short snouts. This may make it more difficult for them to tolerate hot weather, especially while exercising. It is important to make sure they have enough water and monitor them and make sure they are not struggling to breathe.</p>
    <h3>Feeding</h3>
    <p>An American Bulldog diet should be formulated for a large to giant breed, and their high energy level should be taken into consideration. Their needs will change from puppyhood to adulthood.</p>

    <p>It is best to ask your veterinarian or professional nutritionist about your dog's specific nutritional requirements. You should discuss with them how to form an appropriate diet for your dog.</p>
    <h3>Children and other pets</h3>
    <p>As with most breeds, socialization training should begin early for American Bulldogs. So long as they are trained properly, American Bulldogs are great with children and are very loyal to all members of the family. It is also important to train children on how to properly handle and treat animals to avoid incident. Even with properly trained dogs, you should always supervise them when they play with children to make sure things don't get out of hand. American Bulldogs are large animals, and overly energetic play can cause injuries.</p>
    <h3>Size</h3>
    <p>This breed stands quite a bit taller than the English or French Bulldogs. Adorable American Bulldog puppies will grow to 20 to 28 inches in height and 60 to 120 pounds by the time they reach adulthood.</p>
