    <h2>GERMAN SHEPHERD PIT BULL.</h2>
    <img class="back" src="images/german-shepherd-pit-bull.jpg" alt="a german shepherd pit bull cross breed">
    <p>The German Shepherd Pit Bull is a mixed breed dog–a cross between the German Shepherd Dog and American Pit Bull
        Terrier breeds. Medium to large in size, energetic, and loyal, these pups inherited some of the best traits from
        both of their parents.</p>

    <p>The German Shepherd Pit Bull is also sometimes called the German Sheppit, German Pit, and Shepherd Pit. Despite
        their unfortunate status as a designer breed, you may find these pups in shelters and breed specific rescues, so
        remember to adopt.</p>
    <h3>History</h3>
    <p>The German Shepherd Pit Bull dog breed may have existed naturally over the years, but designer breeders started
        intentionally mixing German Shepherd Dogs and American Pit Bull Terriers in the 1990s, likely in North America.
    </p>

    <p>Breeders began to mix the two parent breeds to create a companion, guard dog. The popularity of this particular
        mixed breed is in decline due to Pit Bull bans in some countries and cities across the US.</p>
    <h3>Personality</h3>
    <p>Above all else, German Shepherd Pit Bull's are protective and loyal to those they love. They like big families.
        The bigger they are, the more people to love.</p>

    <p>German Shepherd Pit Bulls will need a big house with a big yard to run around in. Lots of exercise will be a
        requirement for keeping this dog happy.</p>

    <p>When properly socialized during puppyhood, German Shepherd Pit Bulls are not aggressive at all and incredibly
        friendly to people they don't know, as well as other dogs. Get these puppies socialized early on!</p>

    <p>They are highly intelligent and trainable. Use positive reinforcement and a reward system.</p>

    <p>One thing German Shepherd Pit Bulls are not good at is being alone for long periods of time. Without the
        companionship they need—as well as exercise—they become bored and frustrated. A German Shepherd Pit Bull who's
        under-exercised and ignored by their family is likely to express destructive behavior, such as chewing and
        howling.</p>

    <p>The German Shepherd Pit Bull needs early socialization. During puppyhood, take them for walks and introduce them
        to new people, new dogs, new places, and new experiences.</p>
    <h3>Health</h3>
    <p>The German Shepherd Pit Bull breed is predisposed to some of the same conditions that the German Shepherd and
        American Pit Bull Terrier also face. While most are generally healthy, some may be prone to a few health issues,
        which is why it is important to maintain good care and regular veterinary checkups.</p>

    <p>Some of the more common health problems German Shepherd Pit Bulls suffer from include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Skin Irritation</li>
        <li>Hip Dysplasia</li>
        <li>Allergies</li>
        <li>Heart Disease</li>
        <li>Bloat</li>
        <li>Hypothyroidism</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Feeding</h3>
    <p>A German Shepherd Pit Bull, diet should be formulated for a medium- to large-sized breed with high energy and
        exercise needs. You should consult your veterinarian or professional pet nutritionist for advice on what to feed
        your German Shepherd Pit Bull and the correct portion sizes.</p>

    <p>Their dietary needs will change as they grow from puppyhood to adulthood and into their senior years. Stay on top
        of these nutritional requirements.</p>
    <h3>Children and other pets</h3>
    <p>When well-trained and having had plenty of exposure to kids, a German Shepherd Pit Bull is a great companion for
        a large family with kids. However their size could put them at a disadvantage around smaller children. They
        could easily accidentally knock over a toddler.</p>

    <p>It's important to teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between
        dogs and young children. Teach your child never to approach any dog while they're eating or to try to take the
        dog's food away. No matter how friendly, no dog should ever be left unsupervised with a small child.</p>

    <p>German Shepherd Pit Bulls can get along well other dogs, especially if raised with them. Socialization early on
        is a must for this mixed breed. If you're dealing with an adult dog who has not been socialized, they will
        probably require a physically strong handler when in public settings to manage them.</p>
    <h3>Size</h3>
    <p>As the German Shepherd Pit Bull is a relatively new breed, there are few standards when it comes to size. That
        said, as a mix between German Shepherd and American Pit Bull Terrier parents, you can expect German Shepherd Pit
        Bulls to be medium to large in size.</p>

    <p>Most weigh in at 30 to 90 pounds and range in height from 17 to 26 inches at the shoulder. However, many can be
        smaller or larger. The males tend to run slightly larger than females.</p>
