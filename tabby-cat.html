    <h2>TABBY CAT.</h2>
    <img class="back" src="images/tabby cat.jpg" alt="tabby cat image">
    <p>Owners of tabby cats believe that there is more than just the color of their cat that is special.</p>

    <p>These beautiful cats tend to be quite "cat-like", occasionally aloof, but more often mysterious, whimsical and
        even a little magical!.</p>

    <p>The tabby pattern may occur among any number of breeds of purebred cats, and of course, among mixed breeds and
        un-registered house cats as well.</p>
    <p>Tabby kittens tend to be very active , busy and adventurous.</p>

    <p>They may be a handful to corral and a little head-strong. They may put themselves in precarious situations until
        they learn their limitations.</p>

    <p>Kitten-proofing is definitely recommended for anyone considering adopting or purchasing any kitten. High
        furniture should be off limits, caution should be taken when holding these wriggly little youngsters,
        particularly when carrying them across hard wood or tile floors, and spaces under counters and doors should be
        blocked off as they have a very strong urge to explore.</p>
    <p>In appearance, the Tabby kitten is basically a miniature adult, although sometimes tabby kittens are born without
        their stripes and swirls and the tabby coloring appears slowly over the first few weeks of life.</p>

    <p>They tend to grow at an average rate and reach mature height at about 6 months, filling out and maturing to full
        size and weight at about one year old.</p>

    <p>The color can be found in any of dozens of pure-bred cats so there are many to choose from, and tabby kittens are
        regularly available for adoption at local shelters..</p>
