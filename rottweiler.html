    <h2>ROTTWEILER.</h2>
    <img class="back" src="images/rottweiler.jpg" alt="a picture of a rottweiler">
    <P>The Rottweiler was originally dogs bred to drive cattle to market. Later they were used to pull carts for
        butchers. They were among the earliest police dogs and serve with honor in the military.</p>

    <p>Most important, they are popular family guardians and friends. Novice pet parents should beware, as these dogs
        are strong and intense. They need experienced care and training. Consistent, energetic pet parents will find a
        loving, faithful, and intelligent friend for life in a Rottie!</P>
    <h3>History</h3>
    <p>Rottweilers descend from the Molossus, a mastiff-type dog. Their ancestors marched to Germany with the Romans,
        driving the cattle that sustained them as they conquered the known world. As the army traveled, the big dogs
        mated with dogs that were native to the areas they passed through and laid the foundation for new breeds.</p>

    <p>One of the areas through which they passed was southern Germany, where the Romans set up colonies to take
        advantage of climate and soil, which were suitable for agriculture. They built villas roofed with red tile. More
        than 600 years later, as they were building a new church, inhabitants of the town excavated the site of the
        ancient Roman baths and uncovered one of the red-tiled villas. The discovery inspired a new name for the town:
        das Rote Wil (the red tile).</p>
    <h3>Personality</h3>
    <p>The ideal Rottweiler is calm, confident, and courageous, never shy. He has a self-assured aloofness and doesn't
        make friends with people immediately or indiscriminately. Instead, he takes a wait-and-see attitude with new
        people or situations. With his family, he's affectionate, often following them around the house. This is not a
        highly excitable dog. He has an inherent desire to protect his family and property, but should never be
        aggressive toward people without cause. The Rottweiler is smart and adaptable with a strong work ethic.</p>

    <p>You'll see some differences between the sexes. Males are quiet but watchful, constantly assessing their
        surroundings for threats. Females are somewhat easier to control and may be more affectionate. Both are highly
        trainable but can be stubborn.</p>
    <h3>Health</h3>
    <p>Rottweilers are generally healthy, but like all breeds, they're prone to certain health conditions. Not all
        Rotties will get any or all of these diseases, but it's important to be aware of them if you're considering this
        breed.</p>

    <p>If you're buying a puppy, find a good breeder who will show you health clearances for both your puppy's parents.
        Health clearances prove that a dog has been tested for and cleared of a particular condition. In Rotties, you
        should expect to see health clearances from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) for hip dysplasia (with
        a score of fair or better), elbow dysplasia, hypothyroidism, and von Willebrand's disease; from Auburn
        University for thrombopathia; and from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) certifying that eyes are
        normal. You can confirm health clearances by checking the OFA web site (offa.org).</p>
    <h3>Feeding</h3>
    <p>Recommended daily amount: 4 to 10 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals.</p>

    <p>: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are
        individuals, just like people, and they don't all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying
        that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a
        difference â€” the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it
        you'll need to shake into your dog's bowl.</p>
    <h3>Children and other pets</h3>
    <p>Rottweilers typically like children, especially if they're raised with them. When around children, especially
        young ones, they should be supervised because they are so big and strong. Because of their cattle-driving
        heritage, they have a tendency to lean and push and can accidentally topple a toddler with a nudge.</p>

    <p>They're probably best suited to homes with older children who understand how to interact with dogs. It's also
        important to supervise your Rottweiler any time your children have friends over. Rotties can be perturbed by
        loud or rough play between kids and may take steps to put a stop to it, not understanding that "his" children
        aren't in danger. They may also chase young children who are running.</p>

    <p>Always teach children how to approach and touch dogs, and always supervise any interactions between dogs and
        young children to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never
        to approach any dog while he's sleeping or eating or to try to take the dog's food away. No dog should ever be
        left unsupervised with a child.</p>

    <p>When Rottweilers are raised with other dogs and cats, they generally get along well with them. They may have
        issues with strange dogs or adult dogs that are introduced into the home, being intolerant of same-sex dogs.
        With your training and guidance, however, they should accept new animals peaceably. Keep your Rottie on leash in
        public to prevent aggression or belligerence toward other dogs. The Rottie is not the best candidate for
        visiting off-leash dog parks.</p>
    <h3>Size</h3>
    <p>Males typically are 24 to 27 inches tall at the shoulder and weigh 95 to 130 pounds. Females typically are 22 to
        25 inches tall at the shoulder and weigh 85 to 115 pounds.</p>
