        <h1>OUR COMMITMENT TO ANIMAL WELFARE</h1>
        <p>LOGIC’s pet foods meet or exceed the nutrient profiles and manufacturing guidelines of both the World Small
            Animal Veterinary Association (WSAVA) and the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO). In
            fact,
            of the 94 diplomates in the American College of Veterinary Nutrition, LOGIC’s employs four, along with two
            veterinarians who are residency-trained in clinical nutrition.
            Our staff of PhD nutritionists, food scientists, flavorists, and veterinarians take an evidence-based
            approach
            to our process. This extensive team of experts in multiple disciplines has allowed us to continuously
            support
            scientific innovations in pet nutrition.</p>

        <p>LOGIC’s pet foods are put to the test in our Global Pet Nutrition Center, which is unlike any other. Over 200
            scientists and 900+ dogs and cats dedicate their time to ensuring each LOGIC's product provides optimal
            nutrition. Vets and pet parents can rest assured that every Hill’s product has been developed to support the
            nutritional needs of your pet, no matter their age, size or health condition.</p>

        <p>We believe quality care for pets includes nutrition, veterinary health care, daily exercise and lots of love.
            All
            pets at LOGIC's Pet Nutrition live in such an environment.</p>

        <P>We only use compassionate, noninvasive methods necessary to develop nutritional technology so dogs and cats
            around the world live long, healthy lives.</p>
        <h1>OUR MISSION</h1>
        <p>To help enrich and lengthen the special relationships between people and their pets.</p>
        <h1>OUR VISION</h1>
        <p>To make nutrition a cornerstone of veterinary medicine.</p>
        <h1>OUR PHILOSOPHY</h1>
        <p>We believe all animals — from your pet to the companion animals we care for — should be loved and cared for
            during their lifetimes.</p>
